  - If you are working with data from a third party, you  may come across problems such as:
     • JSON that contains a formatting error
     • Numeric data that occasionally has a nonnumeric value
     • An error from a remote server
     • A set of information with one missing value
   - If you know that you may get an error, you can handle it gracefully using the try, catch,
     finally statements. Use them to give your users helpful feedback.
